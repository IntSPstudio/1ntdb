This is my idea / vision of a database system that I have been planning and developing for a long time. It is based on a relational database with its own twist. The idea came from hobbies many years ago when I was looking for a ready-made database of this kind to replace the currently used Access database. The most important feature would be the ability to use the software in a browser on many different devices and to import data, for example, through an API interface.
